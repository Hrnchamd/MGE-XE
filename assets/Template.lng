;;
;; Language file template for MGEXEgui user interface translation.
;; File needs to be saved with UTF-8 encoding, either with or without BOM.
;;

[## Language ##]
;Name = English (Template)
;Translator = Translator's Name

;; Use the following naming scheme for default translations (you may uncomment one,
;; to try if it's displayed on the list of translations in MGEXEgui):
;Name = Český (Czech)
;Name = Danske (Danish)
;Name = Deutsch (German)
;Name = Ελληνικά (Greek)
;Name = Español (Spanish)
;Name = Français (French)
;Name = Italiano (Italian)
;Name = Nederlands (Dutch)
;Name = Polski (Polish)
;Name = Русский (Russian)
;Name = Svenska (Swedish)
;Name = Türk (Turkish)
;
;; If this doesn't want to work with language autodetection, name it in reverse order
;; - i.e. "Greek (Ελληνικά)", "Russian (Русский)", "Spanish (Español)", etc.
;;
;; Language autodetection looks first for language named: "NativeName (EnglishName)",
;; then, if it doesn't find, for languages named: "EnglishName (NativeName)",
;; and next for first of language names starting with "NativeName",
;; and then for first of language names starting with "EnglishName".
;; If it fails for all, the built-in "English (default)" language is used.
;;
;; Localized entry needs to be single-lined, but you can use escape characters,
;; to make it appear as multi-lined, after reading it by INI file interpreter:
;; "\n"		- line feed
;; "\r\n"	- carriage return and line feed
;; "\r"		- carriage return
;;
;; Other characters that are replaced by a special character when escaped are:
;; "\b"		- backspace
;; "\t"		- tab
;;
;; The "&" character inside text indicates the character after will be an Alt+character
;; shortcut that will select the control. These shortcuts appear as an underline; depending
;; on your OS version, underlines will only appear after you press Alt. It is not necessary
;; to have a shortcut for everything, if you wish to add them it should be a unique letter
;; for the tab page or menu.
;;
;; Backslash character inside a localized string (\) needs to be escaped too - i.e. "\\",
;; otherwise it won't be displayed, because it is used to escape following it character.
;; If you need to use a quotation mark (") or semicolon (;) inside a localized string,
;; it's the best to escape them as well - i.e. "\"" or "\;" - because future interpreters
;; might be more or less strict for finding the start and end of quoted strings or comments,
;; than only by first and last occurance of quotation mark, and whether (;) is outside of it.
;;
;; Currently 3 types of sections are supported:
;; [<FormName>.Text]			- for replacing text displayed on controls
;; [<FormName>.ToolTips]		- for replacing tooltips of either controls or tab pages
;; [<FormName>.Strings]			- for replacing other strings that can be displayed
;;
;; ComboBoxes are localized by using the ; character as an item seperator. The number of
;; items must match the template.
;;
;; Tooltips of tab pages are handled differently, so they use the name of a control.
